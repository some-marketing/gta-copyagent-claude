Modified this nifty script provided by GTAs that leveraged ChatGPT as a copywriting agent to work with Anthropic's Claude. 
Claude's API wants specific versions when called so the sheet has a custom script to check for current versions of the 3 models I've included. Ensure that you've enabled that script and set up a recurring task for that at a cadance of your choosing to ensure that you'll always have the most up-to-date version of each of the three models.

Your model choices are:
Better - Opus
Cheaper - Sonnet (though this calls sonnet 3.7 which has enhanced reasoning so it's a pretty good option while being cheaper.)
Fastest - Haiku

Please be sure to input your Business Name and Business type in the main setup page, plus add your Anthropic API key in the field referenced. 
The script works like the original one featured on GTA otherwise, be sure you set up the configuration page as well.

This video gives a rundown on the function of the script: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhUwpsNNiFk

Also as an added bonus I've included my Custom GPT/Claude Project prompts and knowledgebase configurations that I've been using to achieve this before this code came along. If you're paying for the front end of these systems leveraging their custom 
AI systems for purpose built solutions to daily tasks are great.
