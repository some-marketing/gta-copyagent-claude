Modified this nifty script provided by GTA's as a copywriting agent to work with Anthropic's Claude. There's also enhanced version checking to ensure that you'll always have the most up-to-date version of each of the three models that I've added in.

Your choices are:
Better - Opus
Cheaper - Sonnet
Fastest - Haiku

Please be sure to input your Business Name and Business type in the main setup page, plus add your Anthropic API key in the field referenced. 
The script works like the original one featured on GTA otherwise, be sure you set up the configuration page as well.

This video gives a rundown on the function of the script: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhUwpsNNiFk

Also as an added bonus I've included my Custom GPT/Claude Project prompts and knowledgebase configurations that I've been using to achieve this before this code came along. If you're paying for the front end of these systems leveraging their custom 
AI systems for purpose built solutions to daily tasks are great.
